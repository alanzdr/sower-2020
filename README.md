## âœˆ What is

Base HTML Workspace It is one as the name says, a base for creating static HTML pages, they do not have the objective of serving anything ready, just a work table to start polishing

## ðŸ¤” Why

There are several frameworks and tools with the same purpose, but here the objective was to be as open as possible, so that it can be molded and free from any requirement, directly using the tools for its purpose.

The main idea of â€‹â€‹the project is to separate all the development part from the part read by HTML, thus being able to change how the development is done, without changing how it should be in the end.

So, in the end, the project is much more a way of organizing the files, than a development tool.
